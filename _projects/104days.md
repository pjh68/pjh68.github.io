There are 104 days of weekend in each year. Make them count.

104 Days provides a weekend centric view of your calendars. This isn't another calendar to keep up-to-date - it uses your existing calendars, be that on your iPhone, iPad, iCloud or the many integrations that iOS offers (Exchange, Gmail, Yahoo!, Aol, Outlook.com). Shared calendars are supported. Use it to plan your most limited resource with friends and family.

Privacy:
104 Days only accesses your calendar information to show it to you. Your data is kept on your device and isn't sent anywhere else. Not even log data.
Anonymous app usage data and crash reports are collected, if you opt-in, to help me make the app better for you. I cannot see your personal or event information from these.

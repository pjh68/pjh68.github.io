# The background to the "Be Less Shit" approach

The "Be Less Shit" approach originated in a rather unexpected setting - a climbing wall. A group of software developers and outdoor experiential coaches came together with a common goal: to improve their climbing skills and become better climbers. However, they quickly realized that their approach to improving was flawed. They were focusing too much on achieving perfection and not enough on the process of growth and self-reflection.

Through trial and error, they discovered that by embracing their imperfections and focusing on growth rather than perfection, they were able to make significant progress in their climbing skills. They began to apply this same approach to other areas of their lives, including their professional careers, and found that it led to improved performance, increased creativity, and enhanced teamwork.

The "Be Less Shit" approach is rooted in the belief that growth and improvement come from embracing imperfection and focusing on the journey rather than the destination. It emphasizes self-reflection, honest communication, and a willingness to learn from mistakes. The approach has been embraced by coaches, leaders, and individuals across a variety of fields, who seek to cultivate a growth mindset and achieve their full potential.

Overall, the "Be Less Shit" approach has its roots in a community of climbers and coaches who were willing to take a different approach to achieving success. By focusing on growth and self-reflection, they were able to create a more effective and fulfilling path to success, which has since been adopted by many others in various areas of life.


# How does the "Be Less Shit" approach work?

"Be Less Shit" is a coaching approach that emphasizes collaboration, empathy, and growth. It's designed to help coaches build trust with their clients, foster open communication, and work together to achieve goals.

The approach includes several key principles:

1. **Meet people where they're at**: Rather than imposing a rigid coaching plan, "Be Less Shit" encourages coaches to adapt their approach to the unique needs and goals of their clients.
2. **Use radical candor**: "Be Less Shit" encourages coaches to be honest and direct with their clients, while also being empathetic and supportive. This approach helps build trust and fosters a collaborative environment.
3. **Focus on growth, not perfection**: "Be Less Shit" encourages coaches to help their clients identify and work towards achievable goals, rather than striving for perfection. This helps create a sense of progress and momentum, which can be a powerful motivator.
4. **Emphasize self-reflection**: "Be Less Shit" encourages clients to reflect on their own strengths and weaknesses, and to take ownership of their own growth and development. Coaches can help facilitate this process by asking thought-provoking questions and providing guidance and support.

Overall, "Be Less Shit" is a flexible and collaborative coaching approach that is designed to help clients achieve their goals in a supportive and empowering environment. By focusing on growth, self-reflection, and radical candor, coaches can help their clients unlock their full potential and achieve lasting success.

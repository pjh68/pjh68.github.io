I am a geek about engineering management. My personal learning has been a combination of reading great books, practical experience and reflective learning (both solo and group - I love a blameless "why did that go wrong?" discussion). But it is difficult to know what books to recommend to other people. So this is better thought of as a list of books I have found useful on my career journey. 

#Engineering and engineering management

 
Fred Brooks
Mythical Man-Month, The: Essays on Software Engineering

Along with "No Silver Bullets" - bundled into later editions.

And "Slack" by same author


"Remote" - well, spoiler alert: meet up in person periodically. It was the most useless|" read of the pandemic. But ahead of it's time.


Team topologies.. but never really got into it.

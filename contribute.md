This site is build on github pages. This brings the advantage of having familiar collaboration tooling built right in - issues, pull requests, etc. 

This is a bit of an experiment - let's see how it works.

There are two primary mechanisms to engage:
1. Raise an issue via [github issue](https://github.com/pjh68/pjh68.github.io/issues)
2. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/pjh68/pjh68.github.io/pulls)

Here are a few example things you might want to file an issue for:
* Typos, grammar
* Factual inaccuracies
* Unbalanced or biased views
* Missing context
* Alternative opinions

I'm also open to guest posts.
